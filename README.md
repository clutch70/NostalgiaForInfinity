# NostalgiaForInfinity
Trading strategy for the [Freqtrade](https://www.freqtrade.io) crypto bot. For backtesting results, check out the comments in the individual [commit](https://github.com/iterativv/NostalgiaForInfinity/commits/main) page.

## Updated ReadMe
Please see iterativ's [original](https://github.com/iterativv/NostalgiaForInfinity) page for intended ReadMe contents. Only custom changes are documented here.

## Short Branch
For use with *3S or *5S tokens. Essentially, replaces the BTC informative pair with BTC3S/USDT. Wildly untested.

## Auto Fork Sync Workflow
Implement the merge-upstream.yml workflow and its required scripts/merge.sh bash script to enable automatic updates  
of the upstream NFI repo. Setup a secrets environment "default" and set the GHUSER and GHEMAIL env vars.

## Donations
